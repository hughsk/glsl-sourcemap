# glsl-sourcemap [![experimental](http://badges.github.io/stability-badges/dist/experimental.svg)](http://github.com/badges/stability-badges) #

A sourcemap stream for [glslify](http://github.com/chrisdickinson/glslify).

Takes GLSL tokens as input, and throws in `#line` directives and a sourcemap
file at the end.

Pending some changes in a few modules before it works :)
